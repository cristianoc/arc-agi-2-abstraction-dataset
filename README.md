# ARC-AGI-2 Abstraction Dataset

A dataset containing 120 ARC-AGI-2 evaluation tasks with solvers written in **CompDSL**—a purely functional, simply-typed DSL for grid transformation programs. Each solver is guaranteed to terminate with polynomial complexity bounds and maintains equational reasoning properties.

## What is CompDSL?

CompDSL is a purely functional, simply-typed DSL for grid programs embedded in disciplined Python. Every solver is guaranteed to terminate in O(n^d) time with no mutation, recursion, or unbounded loops.

**Core idea**: Write programs using only pure functions, comprehensions, and the single combinator `fold_repaint`—enforced via AST validators and type checking.

## Dataset Overview

This dataset contains solvers for all 120 ARC-AGI-2 **evaluation tasks**, generated using an automated approach combining coding agents with abstraction-refinement techniques.

**Status**: 116 of 120 solvers pass **interpolation** (correctly solve all training examples). Identity baselines are provided for the remaining 4 tasks (142ca369, 21897d95, 271d71e2, da515329) as placeholders for future improvements.

Each task bundle includes:

- **Task Solution** (`solution.py`): Final working Python implementation in CompDSL
- **Abstraction Code** (`abstractions.py`): Reusable abstraction functions and pipelines  
- **Analysis Report** (`abstractions.md`): Detailed abstraction process and DSL specification

For details on the refinement pipeline, see the companion [compositional-program-synthesis](https://github.com/cristianoc/compositional-program-synthesis) repository.

## CompDSL Specification

The `dsl/` directory contains the full specification, validators, and operation registry.

**Documentation**:
- `dsl/README.md` — Quick reference with syntax cheat sheet
- `dsl/DSL.md` — Authoritative specification for contributors
- `dsl/DSL_Research_Note.md` — Design rationale and theoretical foundations

**Validation**: Run `check_lambda_types.py` and `validate_dsl.py` in the `dsl/` directory. See `dsl/DSL.md` for details.

## Task Bundles

Each `tasks/<task-id>/` directory contains:

- **`solution.py`** (required): Solver function. 116 of 120 pass all training examples; 4 are identity baselines.
- **`abstractions.py`** (optional): Reusable helper functions (component analysis, symmetry detection, morphological ops).
- **`abstractions.md`** (optional): Report with DSL specification validated by `check_lambda_types.py`.

Identity baselines omit the optional files.

## Common Patterns

**Per-item local reasoning**: `fold_repaint` over objects, applying local masks  
**Global infer → local render**: First pass builds structure, second pass paints  
**Search/evaluation** (rare): Generate candidates, score, select best

**Domain abstractions**: Component analysis, symmetry detection, morphological ops, geometric/color reasoning, neighborhood rules.

## Usage

```python
# Run a solver
from tasks.1ae2feb7.solution import solve_1ae2feb7
result = solve_1ae2feb7(input_grid)

# Use abstraction helpers
from tasks.1ae2feb7.abstractions import repeat_last_nonzero_block
result = repeat_last_nonzero_block(grid)
```

Check repository consistency: `python check_consistency.py`
