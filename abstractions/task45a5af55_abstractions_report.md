Abstractions explored for ARC task 45a5af55:
- `identity_baseline`: passthrough grid; fails immediately on train case 0 (0/2).
- `rings_with_full_axis`: maps every leading-axis stripe to rings but keeps the bottom stripe, producing oversized outputs (0/2).
- `rings_drop_last_axis_color`: drops the trailing stripe before building concentric rings, matching both training cases (2/2) and aligning with the observed pattern.

Final solver: `rings_drop_last_axis_color`, which reads the dominant axis (rows when height â‰¥ width, otherwise columns), skips the last stripe, and paints concentric square rings with those colors.
