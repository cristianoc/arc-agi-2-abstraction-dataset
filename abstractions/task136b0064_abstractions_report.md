# ARC Task 136b0064 Abstraction Notes

- `identity_right`: copy the seven columns to the right of the separator without reasoning about the digit patterns. Fails immediately (0/3 train) because it ignores the encoded digits on the left.
- `digit_bars`: detect 3Ã—3 digit glyphs on the left, convert each to a compact bar glyph, and place them in order using directional heuristics that keep the bar chain connected. Matches all training cases and produces coherent test output.
