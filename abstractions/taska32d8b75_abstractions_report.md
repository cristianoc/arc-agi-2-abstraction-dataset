# Abstraction Notes for a32d8b75

- `identity`: simply drops the six instruction columns; leaves the right side untouched and fails all three training tasks (0/3).
- `block_map_no_tail`: uses the 3×6 instruction strips to paint 3×3 macro blocks but ignores the trailing leftover rows, so it misses the final sprite rows (2/3 solved, first failure at train[0]).
- `block_map_full` / `solver_module`: same mapping plus tail handling via dedicated two-row templates; renders every training example perfectly (3/3) and produces coherent outputs for the test grids.

Final refinement adopts `block_map_full`, which exactly matches the training outputs while preserving the instruction-driven structure for unseen inputs.
