# ARC Task 1818057f – Abstraction Notes

- **identity** – Baseline projection that returns the grid unchanged; fails immediately on train case 0 (0/3 matches).
- **plus_painter** – Detects any `4`-colored plus (center with four orthogonal `4` neighbours) and recolors the five-cell motif to `8`; perfect on the training split (3/3) and yields the submitted evaluation output.

Final solver mirrors the `plus_painter` abstraction directly; no additional hybrids were necessary.
