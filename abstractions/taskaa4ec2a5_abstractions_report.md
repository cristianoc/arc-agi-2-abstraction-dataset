# Abstractions for ARC task aa4ec2a5

- **identity** – sanity check baseline that copies the input; unsurprisingly scores 0/3 on train (fails case 0).
- **rectangular_frame** – first attempt that draws a full bounding-box frame around each `1` component; captures 2/3 train cases but over-fills rows that contain gaps, tripping case 1.
- **segment_frame** – segment-aware refinement that respects per-row spans and preserves enclosed holes; matches 3/3 train cases and aligns with the final solver output on the held-out test grid.

Final approach: `segment_frame` (packaged in the production solver), which combines hole detection with segment-wise framing so that only the intended neighborhood cells switch to colours `2` and `6`; this resolves every training example and produces a structured extrapolation on the evaluation input.
