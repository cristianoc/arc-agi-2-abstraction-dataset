- chebyshev_parity: basic concentric-square parity around the plus center; captures coarse ring structure but leaves large mismatches (0/3 train solved).
- oriented_toggle: parity with orientation-based flips near diagonals; handles small radii components yet still misses broader wedges (0/3 train solved).
- mapping_solution: data-driven lookup (radius bucketed at â‰¤3) with analytic fallback for larger rings; matches all training tasks and generates the evaluation prediction (3/3 train solved).
