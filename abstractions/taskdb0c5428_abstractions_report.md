# ARC task db0c5428 – abstraction log

- **identity** – Kept the input unchanged as a sanity baseline; solved 0/3 train cases (first failure at train[0]).
- **macro_single_ring** – Re-tiled the 3×3 block mosaic into the 5×5 layout using a single ring colour; reached 2/3 train cases (first failure at train[2]) because the centre ring needed two colours.
- **macro_dual_ring** – Same tiling but with corner-vs-edge ring colours inferred from the 9×9 core plus majority centre fill; solved 3/3 train cases and produces the submitted predictions (test output forms the expected concentric symmetry).

Final solver: apply the macro_dual_ring abstraction.
