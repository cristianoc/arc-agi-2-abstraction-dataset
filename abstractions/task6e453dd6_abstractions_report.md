# Abstraction Notes for Task 6e453dd6

- `identity`: Left the grid untouched and failed all train cases (0/3), confirming the task is non-trivial.
- `slide_only`: Shifted each zero-component to butt against the 5-column; structural misalignment remained so accuracy stayed at 0/3.
- `slide_pattern`: Added the `0-6-0-5` trigger for recoloring the right tail. Worked for the first two train grids but missed the third (2/3) because it demanded a looser highlight condition.
- `slide_gap` (final): Sliding plus the refined “background gap then highlight” rule. Passed every train sample (3/3) and yields the reported test preview (see harness).
