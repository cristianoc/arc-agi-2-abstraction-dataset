# ARC Task 3e6067c3 – Abstraction Notes

- **identity** – copied the grid unchanged; served only as a sanity check and failed on train[0] (0/3 matches).
- **hint_path** – reads the hint row, orders the colored nodes, and paints straight corridors with the source color along each step of the path; achieves 3/3 train matches and produces consistent predictions for both test grids.

Final solver uses the `hint_path` abstraction directly.
