# Abstractions for f560132c

- **identity** – direct passthrough of the input; serves as baseline and fails immediately (`0/2` train, fails at train[0]).
- **size_sorted** – map components to palette colours by descending area without regard to offsets; improves coverage of component shapes but still misses spatial arrangement (`0/2` train, fails at train[0]).
- **offset_oriented** – group components by relative offset from the palette anchor, rotate by quadrant-specific rules, and size the canvas via paired min-sums; reproduces both training cases (`2/2` train) and provides confident predictions on the evaluation input.

Final refinement: adopt the **offset_oriented** abstraction, which yields 100% agreement on the training split and generates a coherent 13×10 prediction for the evaluation grid.
