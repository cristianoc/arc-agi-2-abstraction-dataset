# Task 981571dc Abstraction Notes

- **identity** (matches=0/4): leave the grid unchanged; zeros persist so symmetry never emerges.
- **mirror_nonzero** (matches=0/4): copy colours across the main diagonal when a counterpart exists; cells with zero/zero pairs remain blank and break the pattern.
- **row_match** (matches=4/4): iteratively plug gaps with other rows that agree on visible cells (and, via the transpose pass, matching columns); this already reconstructs the full symmetric mosaic.
- **row_col_match** (matches=4/4): same completion but also considering column candidates during the row phase; settled on this variant for the solver, then enforced diagonal mirroring to tidy any leftovers.

The final row_col_match pipeline generates a symmetric 30Ã—30 grid on the test input, repeating the colour palette seen in training and extending every partial row/column into a consistent counterpart.
