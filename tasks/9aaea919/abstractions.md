# Task 9aaea919 â€“ Abstraction Notes

- `identity`: Pass-through baseline that retains the input grid unchanged. It fails immediately on train case 0 (0/3 matches).
- `instruction_driven`: Interprets the bottom-row markers, recolors flagged columns to color 5, and stacks plus-shaped digits according to the counts encoded by the color-2 columns. Achieves 3/3 matches on the train split; generated test output forms a consistent extended scoreboard.

Final choice: `instruction_driven` abstraction.
