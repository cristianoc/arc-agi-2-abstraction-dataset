# Task 5545f144 – Abstraction Notes

- `intersection`: keeps columns where every segment agrees on the highlight color; handles shared motifs but misses rows where only one segment carries signal (train 0/3).
- `first_segment_shift`: aligns the leftmost segment by stripping separator gaps; fixes single-segment rows yet ignores cross-segment consensus (train 0/3).
- `combined`: merges intersection cues, first-segment shifting, and special handling for two-segment grids to propagate the central column and back-fill supporting rows; matches 3/3 train cases and evaluates smoothly on held-out inputs.

The final solver mirrors the `combined` abstraction, using the consensus check for high-support columns and the alignment/extension rules to recover sparse motifs while respecting the double-segment idiosyncrasy.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `extractSegmentsPerRow : Grid -> List SegmentRow` — partition each row into contiguous non-background segments.
  - `findConsensusColumns : List SegmentRow -> Set Column` — compute columns supported by all segments (intersection rule).
  - `alignFirstSegment : SegmentRow -> SegmentRow` — normalise the leftmost segment by trimming separator gaps.
  - `propagateConsensus : Grid × Set Column × List SegmentRow -> Grid` — paint consensus columns and extend aligned segments with the special two-segment handling.
- **Solver summary**: "Extract row segments, find consensus columns, align the first segment in each row, then propagate the consensus while handling two-segment grids specially."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_5545f144(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    segments = extractSegmentsPerRow(grid)
    consensus = findConsensusColumns(segments)
    aligned = [alignFirstSegment(row) for row in segments]
    return propagateConsensus(grid, consensus, aligned)
```
