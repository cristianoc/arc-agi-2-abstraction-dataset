# Abstraction Notes for 20a9e565

- **column_cycle**: modelled the grid as repeating color cycles across consecutive column groups, emitting color/transition pairs (14×2); fit 1/3 train cases and produced reasonable summaries for evaluation inputs.
- **cross_banner**: treated the unique short-width group as a stem to paint a 3-row banner (3×(2·width)) capturing vertical and horizontal bars; solved the cross-like training example only (1/3).
- **alternating_bar**: encoded the first column color as alternating solid and hollow vertical bars (rows = non-zero columns − 1, width 3); matched the “dual-bar” training case (1/3) and yields compact alternations on evaluation inputs.
- **hybrid**: pattern-classifier combining the above three abstractions by repeating-color detection vs. unique-length cues; matches all training samples and generates structured outputs (22×2 and 3×26) for the evaluation inputs.
