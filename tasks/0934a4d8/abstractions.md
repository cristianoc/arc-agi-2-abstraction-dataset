horizontal_mirror_offset2 — mirror the block opposite the 8 rectangle across the vertical axis with a fixed offset of 2 columns. Worked on 3/4 train cases (first miss at train[2]); fails when the copied block actually lies across the horizontal axis.

vertical_mirror_offset2 — same idea but across the horizontal axis. Also achieved 3/4 train accuracy (first miss at train[0]); fails on instances where the missing block is positioned horizontally.

hybrid_offset2 — select between horizontal and vertical mirrors by comparing the offset distance and preferring the farther candidate (ties broken by the 8-count heuristic). This variation matched all train examples and produces a 9x3 output for the test case, aligning with the copied block observed in the grid.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `bbox : Grid -> BBox` — locate the colour-8 block and return its bounding box `(row0, row1, col0, col1)`.
  - `mirrorH : Grid × BBox -> Candidate` — create a horizontally mirrored candidate `{ block, distance, count8 }`.
  - `mirrorV : Grid × BBox -> Candidate` — create a vertically mirrored candidate `{ block, distance, count8 }`.
  - `selectCandidate : Candidate × Candidate -> Candidate` — pick the farther candidate, breaking ties by the count of 8s.
  - `flipOutput : Candidate -> Block` — flip the chosen candidate along the relevant axis to emit the final block.
- **Solver summary**: "Find the 8-block's bounding box, generate horizontal and vertical mirrored candidates, select the farther one (tie-breaking on 8-count), then flip that block to produce the output."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_0934a4d8(grid: Grid) -> Block:
    bbox_val = bbox(grid)
    h_candidate = mirrorH(grid, bbox_val)
    v_candidate = mirrorV(grid, bbox_val)
    chosen = selectCandidate(h_candidate, v_candidate)
    return flipOutput(chosen)
```
