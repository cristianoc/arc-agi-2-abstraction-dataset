# Task 88e364bc – Abstraction Notes

- **identity** – left the grid untouched. Predictably failed on every training case (0/3).
- **directional_slide** – slid each 4 along the axis with a longer zero corridor. Looked promising in inspection but mis-placed every 4 in practice (0/3, first miss at train[0]).
- **block_template** – recognised the 5×5 digit tiles, zeroed all 4s, then reinserted them at the template-specific offsets. This exactly matches all training outputs (3/3) and is the deployed solver.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `enumerateBlocks5x5 : Grid -> Iterable Block` — iterate over every 5×5 tile in the grid.
  - `lookupBlockRule : Block -> Optional Position` — canonicalise the tile (with 4s cleared) and fetch the target offset from the rule table.
  - `clearBlockFours : Grid × Block -> Grid` — zero out all colour-4 cells in the current block.
  - `placeFourAtOffset : Grid × Block × Position -> Grid` — if a rule returns an offset, place a single colour-4 cell at that location.
- **Solver summary**: "Scan each 5×5 block, look up the rule for its template, clear any 4s inside, and place a single 4 at the rule’s offset when defined."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_88e364bc(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    blocks = list(enumerateBlocks5x5(grid))

    def repaint(canvas: Grid, block: Block) -> Grid:
        position = lookupBlockRule(block)
        cleared = clearBlockFours(canvas, block)
        if position is None:
            return cleared
        return placeFourAtOffset(cleared, block, position)

    return fold_repaint(grid, blocks, repaint)
```
