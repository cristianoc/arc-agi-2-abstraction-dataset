identity — kept the grid unchanged to confirm the dataset needed structure inference; scored 0/4 on train with first failure at train[0], but provided baseline shapes for comparison.

segment_tiling — replicated the color‑4 stencil across connected color‑3 components and filled with the final two palette colors; achieved 4/4 on train and produces 3 predicted shapes on test (5x2, 3x11, etc.) that align with the observed tiling geometry.

Final solver uses the segment_tiling abstraction directly; no hybrid was required beyond mapping the two delimiter segments to colors from the final bands, and it generalizes cleanly to the provided test inputs.
