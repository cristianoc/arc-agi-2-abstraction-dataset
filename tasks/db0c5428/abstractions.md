# ARC task db0c5428 – abstraction log

- **identity** – Kept the input unchanged as a sanity baseline; solved 0/3 train cases (first failure at train[0]).
- **macro_single_ring** – Re-tiled the 3×3 block mosaic into the 5×5 layout using a single ring colour; reached 2/3 train cases (first failure at train[2]) because the centre ring needed two colours.
- **macro_dual_ring** – Same tiling but with corner-vs-edge ring colours inferred from the 9×9 core plus majority centre fill; solved 3/3 train cases and produces the submitted predictions (test output forms the expected concentric symmetry).

Final solver: apply the macro_dual_ring abstraction.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `locateNineBlock : Grid -> Optional Box` — find the 9×9 mosaic bounding box relative to the background colour.
  - `extractMicroBlocks : Grid × Box -> MicroBlocks` — slice the 9×9 region into its nine 3×3 micro blocks.
  - `inferRingPalette : Grid × Box -> RingBlocks` — derive the corner block, edge block, and synthesised centre block.
  - `renderMacroTiling : Grid × Box × MicroBlocks × RingBlocks -> Grid` — map each 5×5 macro position to a source block (or the synthesised centre) and tile the 15×15 output.
- **Solver summary**: "Locate the 9×9 mosaic, extract its 3×3 blocks, infer corner/edge palette and the centre block, then tile the 5×5 macro layout that reuses those blocks (with the synthesised centre)."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_db0c5428(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    box = locateNineBlock(grid)
    if box is None:
        return grid
    micro_blocks = extractMicroBlocks(grid, box)
    ring_blocks = inferRingPalette(grid, box)
    return renderMacroTiling(grid, box, micro_blocks, ring_blocks)
```
