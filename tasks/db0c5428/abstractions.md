# ARC task db0c5428 – abstraction log

- **identity** – Kept the input unchanged as a sanity baseline; solved 0/3 train cases (first failure at train[0]).
- **macro_single_ring** – Re-tiled the 3×3 block mosaic into the 5×5 layout using a single ring colour; reached 2/3 train cases (first failure at train[2]) because the centre ring needed two colours.
- **macro_dual_ring** – Same tiling but with corner-vs-edge ring colours inferred from the 9×9 core plus majority centre fill; solved 3/3 train cases and produces the submitted predictions (test output forms the expected concentric symmetry).

Final solver: apply the macro_dual_ring abstraction.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `locateNineBlock : Grid -> Optional Box` — find the 9×9 mosaic bounding box relative to the background colour.
  - `extractMicroBlocks : Grid × Box -> Dict (Int, Int) -> Block3x3` — slice the 9×9 region into its nine 3×3 micro blocks.
  - `inferRingPalette : Grid × Box -> (Color, Color, Block3x3)` — derive the corner/edge ring colours and synthesise the centre block.
  - `renderMacroTiling : Grid × Dict (Int, Int) -> Block3x3 × Block3x3 -> Grid` — map each 5×5 macro position to a source block (or the synthesised centre) and tile the 15×15 output.
- **Solver summary**: "Locate the 9×9 mosaic, extract its 3×3 blocks, infer corner/edge palette and the centre block, then tile the 5×5 macro layout that reuses those blocks (with the synthesised centre)."
