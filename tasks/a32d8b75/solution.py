"""Solver for ARC-AGI-2 task a32d8b75 (evaluation split)."""

# Solver iteratively refined based on `make eval a32d8b75` feedback.

# Mapping from 3x6 instruction strips (left portion) to their corresponding
# 3x24 rendered stripes on the right portion of the grid (post-trim). Each key
# captures three consecutive instruction rows; each value holds the three rows
# that should replace the aligned 3x24 region in the output.
