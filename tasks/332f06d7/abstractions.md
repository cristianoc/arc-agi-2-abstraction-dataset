# Task 332f06d7 – Abstraction Summary

- **identity** – left the grid untouched; 0/4 train matches (first failure train[0]).
- **swap_to_color2** – always replaced the zero block with the colour-2 component; 2/4 train matches (first failure train[1]).
- **threshold_5** – relocate the zero block to the most central 1-block candidate whose adjacency covers the colour-2 gap when it improves distance-to-centre by ≥5; 4/4 train matches, no failures observed. Test labels unavailable, but the produced outputs align with the expected structural shift.

The final solver uses the `threshold_5` abstraction.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `locateZeroBlock : Grid -> Block` — identify the contiguous background block that must be relocated.
  - `locateColor2Block : Grid -> Block` — locate the colour-2 component’s bounding block for fallback.
  - `collectCandidateBlocks : Grid -> List Block` — list non-background blocks whose adjacency to colour-2 makes them valid swap targets.
  - `scoreCandidates : Block × List Block -> List (Block, Int)` — compute distance-to-centre improvements for each candidate.
  - `relocateZeroBlock : Grid × Block × Block -> Grid` — move the zero block into the best-scoring candidate location and slide the donor block into the original slot.
- **Solver summary**: "Find the zero block, gather candidate donor blocks, keep the one that improves central alignment by at least five while covering the gap, and swap the two blocks."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_332f06d7(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    zero_block = locateZeroBlock(grid)
    candidates = collectCandidateBlocks(grid)
    scored = scoreCandidates(zero_block, candidates)
    best = max(scored, key=lambda x: x[1])
    two_block = locateColor2Block(grid)
    return relocateZeroBlock(grid, zero_block, best[0] if best[1] >= 5 else two_block)
```
