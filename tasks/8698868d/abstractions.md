# Task 8698868d – Abstraction Notes

- `identity`: Pass-through baseline; leaves the composite palette untouched and fails immediately on the first train case (0/2 matches).
- `column_priority_v1`: Rebuilds background tiles but uses a mild column bias when pairing shape exemplars, which mismatches the top-right overlay (1/2 matches; fails on train[1]).
- `column_priority_v2`: Strengthens the column weighting, yielding the intended background→shape assignment and reproducing both training outputs; test inference produces a coherent 2×2 tiling with centered motifs.

Final choice: `column_priority_v2` abstraction.

## DSL Structure
- `_most_common_color : Grid -> Int` — find the dominant color of the grid.
- `_extract_components : Grid × Iterable Int -> List Component` — extract connected components ignoring the given colors.
- `_classify_components : Sequence Component -> Tuple List Component, List Component` — split background tiles from motif shapes.
- `_group_backgrounds : Sequence Component -> Tuple List Component, Int, Int` — attach tile grid positions and infer rows/cols.
- `_assign_shapes : Sequence Component × Sequence Component -> Assignment` — assign shapes to backgrounds using row/column-weighted distance.
- `_render_solution : Grid × Sequence Component × Assignment × Int × Int -> Grid` — render tiled backgrounds and stamp assigned shapes centered.
- `_clone : Grid -> Grid` — clone the grid.

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_8698868d(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    base_color = _most_common_color(grid)
    components = _extract_components(grid, (base_color,))
    backgrounds, shapes = _classify_components(components)

    # Guard: ensure consistent tile sizes
    if not backgrounds or len(backgrounds) != len(shapes):
        return _clone(grid)

    grouped_backgrounds, rows, cols = _group_backgrounds(backgrounds)
    assignment = _assign_shapes(grouped_backgrounds, shapes)
    return _render_solution(grid, grouped_backgrounds, assignment, rows, cols)
```
