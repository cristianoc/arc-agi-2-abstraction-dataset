# Task 8698868d – Abstraction Notes

- `identity`: Pass-through baseline; leaves the composite palette untouched and fails immediately on the first train case (0/2 matches).
- `column_priority_v1`: Rebuilds background tiles but uses a mild column bias when pairing shape exemplars, which mismatches the top-right overlay (1/2 matches; fails on train[1]).
- `column_priority_v2`: Strengthens the column weighting, yielding the intended background→shape assignment and reproducing both training outputs; test inference produces a coherent 2×2 tiling with centered motifs.

Final choice: `column_priority_v2` abstraction.
