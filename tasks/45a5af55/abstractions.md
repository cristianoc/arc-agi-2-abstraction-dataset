Abstractions explored for ARC task 45a5af55:
- `identity_baseline`: passthrough grid; fails immediately on train case 0 (0/2).
- `rings_with_full_axis`: maps every leading-axis stripe to rings but keeps the bottom stripe, producing oversized outputs (0/2).
- `rings_drop_last_axis_color`: drops the trailing stripe before building concentric rings, matching both training cases (2/2) and aligning with the observed pattern.

Final solver: `rings_drop_last_axis_color`, which reads the dominant axis (rows when height ≥ width, otherwise columns), skips the last stripe, and paints concentric square rings with those colors.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `detectDominantAxis : Grid -> Axis` — decide whether rings should be driven by row or column stripes based on grid aspect ratio.
  - `collectAxisStripes : Grid × Axis -> List Color` — read the sequence of stripe colours along the dominant axis.
  - `dropTrailingStripe : List Color -> List Color` — remove the final colour in the sequence before ring synthesis.
  - `renderConcentricRings : Grid × List Color -> Grid` — paint concentric square rings using the remaining colours in order.
- **Solver summary**: "Pick the dominant axis, collect its stripe colours, drop the trailing stripe, and render concentric rings with the remaining colours."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_45a5af55(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    axis = detectDominantAxis(grid)
    stripes = collectAxisStripes(grid, axis)
    ring_colors = dropTrailingStripe(stripes)
    return renderConcentricRings(grid, ring_colors)
```
