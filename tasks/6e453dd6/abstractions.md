# Abstraction Notes for Task 6e453dd6

- `identity`: Left the grid untouched and failed all train cases (0/3), confirming the task is non-trivial.
- `slide_only`: Shifted each zero-component to butt against the 5-column; structural misalignment remained so accuracy stayed at 0/3.
- `slide_pattern`: Added the `0-6-0-5` trigger for recoloring the right tail. Worked for the first two train grids but missed the third (2/3) because it demanded a looser highlight condition.
- `slide_gap` (final): Sliding plus the refined “background gap then highlight” rule. Passed every train sample (3/3) and yields the reported test preview (see harness).

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `locateFiveColumn : Grid -> Optional Int` — return the first column containing colour 5 to act as the sliding barrier.
  - `extractZeroComponents : Grid × Int -> List Component` — gather zero-valued components strictly to the left of the 5-column.
  - `slideComponentsRight : List Component × Int -> Grid` — shift each zero-component rightward so its right edge touches the 5-column.
  - `highlightRowTail : Grid × Int × Color × Color -> Grid` — scan rows with `background,0,5` at the barrier, and repaint cells to the right with the highlight colour.
- **Solver summary**: "Find the 5-column, slide every zero-component against it, restore the right region, then highlight rows whose zeros border a background gap next to the 5."
