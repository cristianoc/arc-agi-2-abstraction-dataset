# b5ca7ac4 Abstraction Summary

- **identity** – left the grid untouched; serves as the baseline and unsurprisingly scored 0/3 on the training cases.
- **lane_pack_naive** – detected 5x5 ring objects and pushed both outer-color groups straight to their respective borders without any lane preference; collided objects and likewise failed 0/3.
- **lane_pack_threshold** – reused the same object detection but steered the right-border group by comparing original x-positions against their mean before falling back to the alternate lane on conflicts; achieved 3/3 on train, produced 22×22 outputs for the test case, and matches the solver in `arc2_samples/b5ca7ac4.py`.

The successful refinement preserves each object's original vertical placement, routes higher outer colors to the left border, and alternates/right-justifies the lower-color rings so that no two overlap, yielding the exact training labels and a coherent arrangement on the held-out test input.
