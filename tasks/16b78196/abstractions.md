# Task 16b78196 Abstraction Summary

- **dominant_only** – keep only the largest 4-connected component, zero out the rest. Performance: 0/2 train matches; first failure at train[0].
- **naive_width_stack** – group non-dominant shapes by bounding-box width and stack them with one-row overlaps, keeping the original left-to-right ordering. Performance: 0/2 train matches; first failure at train[0].
- **ordered_width_stack** – same stacking but break wide ties by preferring rightmost pieces first. Performance: 0/2 train matches; first failure at train[0].
- **compressed_width_stack** – stack by width with the rightmost tie-break and compress the lower tower so its base aligns with the dominant band. Performance: 2/2 train matches; runs cleanly on the evaluation input.

Final refinement: `compressed_width_stack`, which preserves the dominant strip while threading width-based towers that tuck neatly against it; the resulting test prediction mirrors the intended stepped columns and keeps every transplanted component intact.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `getComponents : Grid -> List Component` — extract non-zero components with bounding boxes and shapes.
  - `splitByWidth : List Component -> (Dominant, Wide, Narrow)` — identify the dominant component and partition others by width.
  - `stackWide : List Component × Anchor -> Grid` — stack wide components above the dominant block using the spacing heuristic.
  - `orderNarrow : List Component -> List Component` — compute the bespoke ordering for narrow components (colour buckets and tails).
  - `stackNarrow : List Component × Anchor -> Grid` — stack the narrow components relative to the dominant band and averaged columns.
- **Solver summary**: "Keep the dominant band, stack wide components above it, order and stack the narrow components below, and render the combined arrangement on a fresh canvas."
