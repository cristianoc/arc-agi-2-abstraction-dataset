# Task 16b78196 Abstraction Summary

- **dominant_only** – keep only the largest 4-connected component, zero out the rest. Performance: 0/2 train matches; first failure at train[0].
- **naive_width_stack** – group non-dominant shapes by bounding-box width and stack them with one-row overlaps, keeping the original left-to-right ordering. Performance: 0/2 train matches; first failure at train[0].
- **ordered_width_stack** – same stacking but break wide ties by preferring rightmost pieces first. Performance: 0/2 train matches; first failure at train[0].
- **compressed_width_stack** – stack by width with the rightmost tie-break and compress the lower tower so its base aligns with the dominant band. Performance: 2/2 train matches; runs cleanly on the evaluation input.

Final refinement: `compressed_width_stack`, which preserves the dominant strip while threading width-based towers that tuck neatly against it; the resulting test prediction mirrors the intended stepped columns and keeps every transplanted component intact.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `getComponents : Grid -> List Component` — extract non-zero components with bounding boxes and shapes.
  - `splitByWidth : List Component -> (Component, List Component, List Component)` — identify the dominant component and partition the remainder into wide and narrow sets.
  - `paintDominantBand : Grid × Component -> Grid` — copy the dominant strip onto a fresh canvas.
  - `placeWideComponents : Grid × List Component × Component -> Grid` — stack wide components above the dominant band using the spacing heuristic.
  - `orderNarrow : List Component -> List Component` — compute the bespoke ordering for narrow components (colour buckets and tails).
  - `placeNarrowComponents : Grid × List Component × Component -> Grid` — tuck the ordered narrow components beneath the dominant band while preserving alignment.
- **Solver summary**: "Keep the dominant band, stack wide components above it, order and stack the narrow components below, and render the combined arrangement on a fresh canvas."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_16b78196(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    components = getComponents(grid)
    dominant, wide, narrow = splitByWidth(components)
    
    result = paintDominantBand(grid, dominant)
    result = placeWideComponents(result, wide, dominant)
    ordered_narrow = orderNarrow(narrow)
    return placeNarrowComponents(result, ordered_narrow, dominant)
```
