# ARC Task 3e6067c3 – Abstraction Notes

- **identity** – copied the grid unchanged; served only as a sanity check and failed on train[0] (0/3 matches).
- **hint_path** – reads the hint row, orders the colored nodes, and paints straight corridors with the source color along each step of the path; achieves 3/3 train matches and produces consistent predictions for both test grids.

Final solver uses the `hint_path` abstraction directly.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `parseHintRow : Grid -> List Hint` — read the hint row to obtain the ordered list of coloured nodes.
  - `buildHintPath : List Hint -> List Segment` — convert the hint ordering into straight-line segments between consecutive nodes.
  - `traceSegmentCells : Grid × Segment -> List Cell` — enumerate the cells along each straight segment using the source colour.
  - `paintHintPath : Grid × List Cell -> Grid` — draw the traced path onto a blank canvas, leaving non-hint cells as background.
- **Solver summary**: "Parse the hint row, build the ordered path segments, trace each segment’s cells, and paint those cells to realise the hinted corridors."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_3e6067c3(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    hints = parseHintRow(grid)
    segments = buildHintPath(hints)
    cells = [cell for segment in segments for cell in traceSegmentCells(grid, segment)]
    return paintHintPath(grid, cells)
```
