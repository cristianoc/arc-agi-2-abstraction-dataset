# Abstraction Summary – Task 58f5dbd5

- **identity:** copies the input grid without analysis; matches 0/3 training cases (first failure train[0]).
- **scoreboard:** clusters high-area colors, picks a row×column layout, and paints the learnt 5×5 glyph per slot; matches 3/3 training cases and is used for the final solver.

The final refinement is the **scoreboard** abstraction, which reliably reproduces the provided outputs and yields a coherent 3×2 glyph board on the withheld test input.
