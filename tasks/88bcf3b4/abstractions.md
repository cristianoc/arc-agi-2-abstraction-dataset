# ARC Task 88bcf3b4 – Abstraction Summary

- **identity**: Directly copies the input grid. Serves as a sanity baseline; fails immediately (train[0], pixel ≈ 92%).
- **path_projection**: Detects the anchor column, adjacent accent mass, and nearest target component, then draws a monotone king-move path governed by approach/plateau/departure heuristics. Achieves 100% exact matches on the train split and produces well-structured predictions for the evaluation inputs.

Final solver uses `path_projection` alone—the identity baseline only informed the initial failure pattern. The path abstraction captures the observed diagonal-to-plateau geometry around the target component and respects boundary constraints, matching all labelled examples.
