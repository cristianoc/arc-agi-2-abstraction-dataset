# ARC task 2b83f449 â€“ abstraction notes

- `identity_abstraction`: leaves the grid untouched; 0/2 train matches because the task requires recolouring the 7-structures and boundary cues.
- `cross_paint_abstraction`: repaints each length-3 run of 7s as vertical + horizontal crosses (colour 6) but keeps the rest intact; 0/2 train because boundary colour (3) logic is missing.
- `refined`: adds zero-distance bookkeeping to colour the necessary boundary cells in 3 while preserving the new 6-crosses; 2/2 train and matches the provided test expectation.
