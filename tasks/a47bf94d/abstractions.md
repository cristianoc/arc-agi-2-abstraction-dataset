# Abstraction Report — Task a47bf94d

- **square_to_plus** — replaces every detected 3×3 solid square with a hollow plus cross. On the train set it misses all cases (0/3) because it leaves the complementary X patterns unaddressed.
- **paired_plus_x** — the final solver that pairs every color with both a plus and diagonal X slot, using shared axes and default positions derived from the board layout. It fits all train examples (3/3) and produces consistent predictions for the held-out test input.

The refinement from the first abstraction to the final one consisted of introducing mirrored X placements alongside the plus crosses, aligning them on shared axes determined by existing patterns or inferred empty space.
