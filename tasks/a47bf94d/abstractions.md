# Abstraction Report — Task a47bf94d

- **square_to_plus** — replaces every detected 3×3 solid square with a hollow plus cross. On the train set it misses all cases (0/3) because it leaves the complementary X patterns unaddressed.
- **paired_plus_x** — the final solver that pairs every color with both a plus and diagonal X slot, using shared axes and default positions derived from the board layout. It fits all train examples (3/3) and produces consistent predictions for the held-out test input.

The refinement from the first abstraction to the final one consisted of introducing mirrored X placements alongside the plus crosses, aligning them on shared axes determined by existing patterns or inferred empty space.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `detect3x3Squares : Grid -> ColourCentres` — find solid 3×3 squares and record their centres.
  - `detectExistingPatterns : Grid -> (ColourCentres, ColourCentres)` — locate existing plus and diagonal patterns to infer axes.
  - `determinePlacementCentres : ColourCentres × ColourCentres × ColourCentres -> PlacementMap` — choose the shared row/column axis for placing new shapes.
  - `placePlus : Grid × Cell × Color -> Grid` — draw a plus pattern centred on the chosen coordinate.
  - `placeDiagonalX : Grid × Cell × Color -> Grid` — draw an X pattern centred on the chosen coordinate.
- **Solver summary**: "Detect 3×3 squares, infer placement axes from existing patterns, and for each colour place both a plus and a diagonal X centred on the computed axis positions."

## Lambda Representation

```python
def solve_a47bf94d(grid: Grid) -> Grid:
    squares = detect3x3Squares(grid)
    plus_axes, x_axes = detectExistingPatterns(grid)
    centres = determinePlacementCentres(plus_axes, x_axes, squares)

    def overlay(canvas: Grid, entry):
        colour, (plus_centre, x_centre) = entry
        with_plus = placePlus(canvas, plus_centre, colour)
        return placeDiagonalX(with_plus, x_centre, colour)

    return fold_repaint(grid, list(centres.items()), overlay)
```
