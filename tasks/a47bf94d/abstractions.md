# Abstraction Report — Task a47bf94d

- **square_to_plus** — replaces every detected 3×3 solid square with a hollow plus cross. On the train set it misses all cases (0/3) because it leaves the complementary X patterns unaddressed.
- **paired_plus_x** — the final solver that pairs every color with both a plus and diagonal X slot, using shared axes and default positions derived from the board layout. It fits all train examples (3/3) and produces consistent predictions for the held-out test input.

The refinement from the first abstraction to the final one consisted of introducing mirrored X placements alongside the plus crosses, aligning them on shared axes determined by existing patterns or inferred empty space.

## DSL Structure
- **Typed operations**
  - `detect3x3Squares : Grid -> Dict Color -> List Cell` — find solid 3×3 squares and record their centres.
  - `detectExistingPatterns : Grid -> (Dict Color -> Cell, Dict Color -> Cell)` — locate existing plus and diagonal patterns to infer axes.
  - `determineAxes : Dict Color -> Cell × Dict Color -> Cell -> (Orientation, Int)` — choose the shared row/column axis for placing new shapes.
  - `placePlus : Grid × Cell × Color -> Grid` — draw a plus pattern centred on the chosen coordinate.
  - `placeDiagonalX : Grid × Cell × Color -> Grid` — draw an X pattern centred on the chosen coordinate.
- **Solver summary**: "Detect 3×3 squares, infer placement axes from existing patterns, and for each colour place both a plus and a diagonal X centred on the computed axis positions."
