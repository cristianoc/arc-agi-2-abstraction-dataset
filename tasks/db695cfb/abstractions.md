# Abstractions for ARC task db695cfb

- **identity** – served as the sanity baseline; leaves grids unchanged and scores 0/5 on train, immediately failing the first example.
- **connect_ones** – draws diagonal segments that bridge matching `1` endpoints; reaches 2/5 train cases but misses situations where embedded `6`s must propagate.
- **connect_and_extend** – connects the `1` pairs *and* projects perpendicular diagonals from any `6` that lies on those paths; this hybrid matches 5/5 train cases and produces the submitted test prediction shown in the harness log.

Final approach: `connect_and_extend`, which combines the diagonal-bridging abstraction with perpendicular `6` propagation to satisfy every training example and yields a coherent extrapolation on the test grid.
